# screen-serve

My first C++ application -- in progress. It receives messages sent via TCP from a Vantage Control lighting system and displays an informational screen that will be shared to tablet devices placed strategically around a private facility.

This repository is here mostly to document my progress as I learn C++ and the JUCE framework.
